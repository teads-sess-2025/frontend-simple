# SESS-Frontend

## Prerequisites
- npm
- Node v22.12+

## Development server
Run `ng serve` to start a development server.
- The application will run at `http://localhost:4200/`.
- When running on the development server, the application is connected to the **local development backend**
- If you want the local development server to connect to the **production backend**, start it with the command `ng serve -c production`
- The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- You can stop the development server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the console

## Set backend URL
You can change the location of the backend in the environment files:
- `src/environments/environment.development.ts` for **local development backend**
- `src/environments/environment.ts` for **production backend**

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running in Docker
If you wish to run the application in Docker (which is optional), use the following commands:
- `make build_docker`: Prepares a Docker image
- `make run_docker`: Runs the docker image and serves the application on port 80.
  - It can be accessed at the URL http://localhost
  - When running in Docker, the application is connected to the **production backend**
- `make stop_docker`: Stops the Docker instance

    - Source: Other
- Advanced tab:
  - Region: West Europe
- Click Review + create
- Go back to https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2FStaticSites and wait for the new app to appear (~1 minute)
- Click on the new app, open the tab "Manage deployment token" and copy the value
- In the GitHub project set the following:
  - Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret
    - Name: AZURE_TOKEN
    - Value: [paste token value]
3. In the GitHub project go to the Actions tab:
  - Click on "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
